This project used a Recurrent Neural Network popularly known as LSTM to predict Bitcoin prices given a set of time-stamped values from the past.

The following are the results:
1. R2_Score between predicted values (y_pred) and actual values (y) is 0.999
2. Mean Absolute Error between predicted values (y_pred) and actual values (y) is 0.009
3. RMSE values between y_pred and y is 0.014
